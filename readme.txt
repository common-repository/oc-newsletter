= What is SMTP? =

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is an industry standard for sending emails. SMTP helps increase email deliverability by using proper authentication.

Popular email clients like Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc are constantly improving their services to reduce email spam. One of the things their spam tools look for is whether an email is originating from the location it claims to be originating from.

If the proper authentication isn’t there, then the emails either go in your SPAM folder or worst not get delivered at all.

The issue is that most <a href"http://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/" rel="friend">WordPress hosting companies</a> don’t have their servers properly configured for sending PHP emails.

The combination of two causes your WordPress emails to not get delivered.
